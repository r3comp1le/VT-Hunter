### OnGoing Project

A web interface to manage VT alerts locally (pulls them down from VT). Make it easier to search, filter, view, etc.  Also has ability to check files in Crits and soon to be MISP.  Written in PHP.

This will pull VT alerts via the JSON api, store them into Mongo, and delete the alert on VT.

WHY?  I like to be able to quickly filter and search on ANY of the fields.  Sort results.  Quickly see duplicates.  Integrate with Crits to validate if this is a new sample.  View the yara syntax it alerted on.  See if my AV detects it according to VT.  Quickly remove false positives, like file type C (someone uploading snort or yara rules) or giant files sizes, or only wanting Win32 Exe files, etc.

  - If you see php code when loading, probably means PHP Short tags isnt enabled
  - PHP Short tags - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2185320/how-to-enable-php-short-tags
  
    ```sh
    /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini:short_open_tag = On
    /etc/php5/cli/php.ini.ucf-old:short_open_tag = On
    /etc/php5/cli/php.ini:short_open_tag = On
    ```
	
  - Make sure you Crits URL is correct. The $crits_url should be everything BEFORE the /api/v1
